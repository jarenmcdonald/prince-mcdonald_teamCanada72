          <h3>The First "Team Canada"</h3>

          <p class="quoteText">In 1972, an eight-game hockey series took place between
              Canada and the Soviet Union. Intended to improve relations between the two
              rivals, it ended up as the closest thing to open conflict ever experienced between
              the two nations.
          </p>
        </section>

          <div class="small-12 columns" id="summitSeriesCopy">

            <p>After the Second World War, the western countries and the Soviet Union turned
                from allies to enemies. In the 1950s, the division between communist and
                non-communist nations deepened until the two sides teetered on the brink of
                nuclear warfare. Known as the "Cold War," it was a situation that threatened to
                escalate worldwide.
            </p>

            <p>In 1970, during this same time of global tensions, Canada withdrew from
                playing international hockey, unhappy when the rules changed to forbid
                professional players. With Canada no longer competing, the Soviets further
                dominated events like the Olympics and IIHF World Championships, but the
                "amateur" level was no longer enough and they sought a more worthy opponent
                - they wanted to take on Canada's best hockey players, all of whom were NHL
                pros.
            </p>

            <p>Beginning as a discussion between low-level Soviet and Canadian diplomats in
                Moscow, the idea of exhibition games between the world's two dominant hockey
                nations looked like a way to help thaw the Cold War. After years of diplomatic
                and logistical arrangements, an eight-game competition that became known as
                the "Summit Series" was announced - the Soviets would ice their national squad
                against the first all-pro team to represent Canada - the very first "Team Canada"
                - in September 1972.

          <p>On a sweltering night in Montreal, many in Canada tuned in to watch Game One of the series.</p>
          <p>Those who predicted a Canadian sweep of the series were buoyed when Esposito scored 30 seconds into the first period. But the buoyancy wasn't to last. Everyone who watched Team Canada's humiliating 7-3 loss that night also witnessed the end of the nation's assumption of hockey superiority. The Russians proved to be just as good - and maybe better.</p>

        <h4>September 4, 1972 - Maple Leaf Gardens - Toronto, ON</h4> <h4>CAN 4 | USSR 1</h4>

        <p>Playing a hard-checking, physically demanding "Canadian" style, Team Canada dominated with its puck possession, superior team play and emotional level. Sinden, one of the few Canadians to have played against the Soviets previously, considered this game as one of the two best his squad played in the series. Several times during the broadcast Hewitt said the Canadians "were playing as a team."</p>
        <p>The 4-1 victory was a reflection of Sinden's ability to break the Soviet five-man system and allow his players to beat their opponents in one-on-one play.</p>
        <p>The Soviets had finally met the worthy opponent they had looked for and prepared themselves for.</p>
        <p>And off the ice, the media echoed the sentiments of viewing public who felt the now-tied series represented the Cold War itself.</p>

      <p>Despite out-shooting the Russians 15-9 in the first period, Team Canada only led by a 2-1 margin. Canada played very well in the first period, led by Jean-Paul Parise's goal just 1:54 into the game. Vladimir Petrov answered back for the Soviets, but Jean Ratelle tapped in a wonderful pass from Yvan Cournoyer to give Canada the lead after one.</p>

      <p>The Russians seamlessly inserted six new players into their line-up that evening, scored two shorthanded goals and looked more like they had in Montreal, which was very good (compared to the media coverage for Team Canada, which was not)</p>

      <h3>Game 4:</h3>
      <h4>September 8, 1972 - Pacific Coliseum - Vancouver, BC - USSR 5 | CAN 3</h4>
      <p>After a shocking loss in Montreal and a less than impressive effort in Winnipeg, it was becoming obvious that Canadian fans were becoming increasingly frustrated with the results. That would be hammered home by the end of the night. Vancouver's Pacific Coliseum played host to Game 4, but it would not be a friendly venue for Team Canada.</p>
      <p>After Team Canada's gruelling 5-3 loss - where some in the crowd cheered the Soviets and booed the Canadians - Esposito was selected as the Canadian player of the game and used the post-game interview to chastise all the negativity directed towards the squad. Esposito, with his heart on his sleeve, looked straight into the camera and into the soul of the nation. He told everyone watching that the players were not there for money or fame, but "because we love Canada".</p>

    </div>
      <p>For the country, it was a time of reflection. For the series, it was a defining moment. Esposito had become the real captain of Team Canada (or, as Gary Bergman called him, their "vociferous leader") and promised the nation that "we're gonna get better, I know it". With the entire country at an all-time low, he lifted the team on his back and went on the road.</p>
